# Executive Summary
**Persistent Chat** can be seen as an evolution of how teams communicate and collaborate with each other. With the advent of an increasingly remote and globally diverse workforce, the need to communicate quickly and efficiently is paramount.

Email is widely used as a standard business communication tool, specifically as it relates to working across company lines. However, the use of email, especially internally, has been construed as a “chat” tool. That was never it’s intended purpose. As such, we end up spending enormous amounts of time reading, organizing, and responding to email. With the need to quickly respond to each other and answer questions quickly and efficiently, email does and will not fit the bill as a viable solution to scale for this purpose. Additionally, email does not allow us to efficiently form affinity groups or teams, yet this is how the majority of us operate.

Social networks for the enterprise, such as Yammer and Facebook Workplace, serve a purpose but are also not a viable solution for quick chat collaboration. They are cluttered and not real-time. Consider the chart to the right. Yammer has a narrow impact between two-way conversation and one-way broadcasts. It does not support business critical collaboration or information storage very well. SharePoint and Confluence on the other hand struggle with two-way communication. That's not their intended purpose. Persistent chat is an evolution that bridges one-way, two-way, casual, and purposeful communication streams within a single solution.

Investigation of tool convergence shows other solutions are not as capable. Slack enables us to leverage our technical capabilities, such as IoT, via ChatOps.

> "ChatOps is a collaboration model that connects people, tools, process, and automation into a transparent workflow. This flow connects the work needed,  the work happening, and the work done in a persistent location staffed by > the people, bots, and related tools." - Sean Regan, Hipchat

Over time, the history our company builds in Slack will serve as our digital brain containing decisions, important information, team history, and stories about our culture. No other tool can do this. Bridging the gaps between company lines with a tool like Slack, yet maintaining security and control, is entirely possible with this platform. The benefits of working together seamlessly across company lines can be an incredible benefit.

In fact, we are already seeing usage of Slack increase inside our own company walls as well as outside. For example, `[XYZ]` team is using it for their team collaboration. `[Company]` has included Slack on their roadmap for adoption in the near future. Other clients, such as `[Customer A]` and `[Customer B]` have requested to collaborate with us via Slack.

This document describes in detail the business case made for implementing Slack. Specifically addressing cost-benefit, use cases, implementation steps and basic guidelines for use.
