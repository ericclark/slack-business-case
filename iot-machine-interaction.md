# Internet of Things, Machine Interaction,  & Machine Learning

The driving power behind the latest buzzwords is the general idea that we can leverage technology to do as much work as possible autonomously, invoking human interaction when necessary in a way both respectful to their preferences and time. Slack provides a common, easy interface to do just that, lending to the birth of ChatOps.

> "ChatOps is a collaboration model that connects people, tools, process, and automation into a transparent workflow. This flow connects the work needed, the work happening, and the work done in a persistent location staffed by the people, bots, and related tools." - Sean Regan, Hipchat

Our adoption is just starting but the rate of user adoption demonstrates demand. Our internal source version control system made an early appearance on Slack, allowing project authors to determine the relevant content and context. Users of Slack get notified of changes to projects they are interested in. Visibility of valuable projects that might have gone unnoticed before is greatly increased. We've seen users merge projects to collaborate on single code bases, and new users getting involved in projects weekly.

Teams and users get notifications of critical data to their teams’ performance with relevant information to assist in taking action. Due to the customizable nature of message delivery, the amount of noise generated is tailored to the individual need. Some individuals or teams enjoy seeing everything going on to keep people on the same page as others prefer only actionable and critical incidents are surfaced.

These examples are just the start, the sky is limited by our own demand and policy. Do we want to be able to take action on remote hosts from the chat line? It'd be great for learning, team knowledge, peer review, but perhaps it’s too much noise, or we don't want to interconnect direct action on hosts from chat. These are decisions that will need to be considered and made as we encounter them but having the power and flexibility to pursue them is advantageous.

Connecting "the work needed, the work happening, and the work done in a persistent location staffed by the people, bots, and related tools" is a goal in sight.
