# Financial Analysis

Slack offers three paid tiers: Standard, Plus and Enterprise.

The Standard plan costs $6.67/user/mo when paid annually. The same plan is $8/user/mo without an annual commitment.

The Plus plan contains everything in Standard, but adds additional functionality such as SAML SSO, 99.99% uptime guarantee, and 24/7 support with a 4-hour SLA. The Plus plan costs $12.50/user/mo when paid annually ($15/user/mo monthly).

The Enterprise plan contains everything in the Plus plan and, for example, federation across multiple teams, unified security, and compliance policies.

## Fair billing policy

Slack only bills customers for what they use. If a user goes inactive, Slack will credit the account for the period that user is inactive. On an annual commitment, we estimate the number of users we think we need and pay that amount up front. Slack will review our account and automatically credit us for any inactive users. While we may pay a certain amount up front, we can know that we will only be paying for what is actually being used on a monthly basis.

## Cost Estimate

For the purpose of this report, we will evaluate the Standard and Plus plan costs. There are 122 active users in our Slack account as of this report. We will use 200 as our active user count for the purpose of estimating costs below. This is to account for the majority of the company.

|               | Standard      | Plus  |Enterprise|
|---------------|---------------|-------|-----|
| Price/user/mo (billed annually)      | $6.67 | $12.50 |Custom pricing at 1000+ users|
| Price/user/mo (billed monthly)    | $8      |   $15 ||
| Annual cost for 200 active users | $16,008      |    $30,000 ||
| Monthly cost for 200 active users | $1,600    |    $3,000 ||
| Discount for paying annually | 17%     |    17% ||

We expect paying for 200 accounts will allow us to support the entire company based on fluctuating usage.
