# Return on Investment

It is difficult to measure with precision the amount of time and money saved by improving employee efficiency. We do not have a baseline in place with which to compare such measures. In order to estimate our return on investment, we will look at the costs associated with managing email and attending meetings.

A study conducted by McKinsey & Company in 2012 revealed that works spend more than 25% of their day reading and responding to email. At `[Our Company]`, this number is likely higher due to our field and nature of work. Based on a survey conducted by Slack in 2015, Slack was able to, on weighted average, reduce internal email by 48%. Letâ€™s assume conservatively that we spend 12.5% of our time on email. If we reduced this down to 6.5% for 200 employees, we would create a balance of 23,000 hours per year that could be repurposed for billable or other strategic activities.

Meetings are another source of waste that Slack claims to reduce by, on weighted average, 25%. As an example, consider the cost of an average one-hour weekly team meeting for an 8-person team. Assuming the average cost of a FTE is approximately $65/hour, one team meeting costs $520. Hold these meeting 48 times per year, the cost is approximately $24,960 for one team. If we were able to reduce those by 25% to 36 meetings per year, we would save $6,240 per team.

As we grow larger, we must grow smaller. Slack is uniquely positioned to create a sense of smaller, more close-knit teams, even though our team sizes may grow larger and more geographically diverse.
