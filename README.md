# History
This repository is for anyone who is trying to make the case for using Slack at their company. I made the case to my own company and came up with this document as a way to create buy in and show that we had done our homework.

I originally shared this template as a Word document [on my blog](https://ericleeclark.com/making-the-business-case-for-using-slack-at-your-company/). Since then I have published the content in this repository in hopes that others can contribute and make the business case even better.

# Start Here
Start by visiting the [Table of Contents](toc.md), which links to all other sections of the business case.

# Doc Conversion
If you want to get fancy you can try using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to convert these Markdown files to PDF, .docx, etc.
