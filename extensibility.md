"The idea is to turn Slack into a “command center” that [connects with other cloud business software](http://fortune.com/2015/09/14/box-slack-documents-reimagining/). “We want to help more developers make a bet on the Slack platform,” said April Underwood, a former Twitter executive who [joined Slack in June 2015](http://fortune.com/2015/06/24/slack-claims-1-1m-users/) to craft its partnership strategy.

In our current state we're limited to our integration capabilities, but we're already seeing a lot of user adoption. RSS feeds help getting information delivered to those needing it in a timely manner, in two cases of vulnerabilities we knew about issues nearly instantly and were able to provide knowledge to our customers as they contacted us in short order after.

There has even been discussion during the `[Project]` design session of benefits of integration of Slack with `[Product/Project]`. To have inline topical conversation from directly in the app might deliver a lot of value that helps differentiate us from our competition. Alternatively, the ability to access and interact with `[Product]` directly from the chat line provide team visibility to actions taken. It’ll be much harder for onboarding clients or entities in snooze to catch a team by surprise!
