# Breaking Down Information Silos

Slack is a path to break down barriers and empower the individual and the team. This facilitates continuous improvement.

We see opportunities for effective cross-team learning nearly daily on Slack as we tackle increasingly complex challenges and continuously improve our performance. Being able to maintain and nurture that knowledge in a persistent system with strong search functionality lets us recycle that effort and continue to grow upon it. We arenâ€™t the only people who benefit. The customer wins from this dynamic as we align as a whole and together are better equipped to deliver value to them.

More access to information allows teams to work individually and cooperatively to continuously improve our processes. There is a persistent discussion available to interested parties that fights tribal knowledge and facilitates better delivery. We can store decision processes and options explored. Staff can come to the table more prepared. We collectively offer more value by exposing these critical details for consumption.
